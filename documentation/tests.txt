Here's a comprehensive description of the testing suite:

The testing suite is organized into individual test files that validate different aspects of the system, with each focusing on specific components while also ensuring they work together correctly. The `test_models.py` file forms the foundation, testing all core domain objects like PrintShops, Orders, Locations, and Clusters. It verifies fundamental business logic such as distance calculations, capacity management, inventory tracking, and status transitions. These tests ensure the basic building blocks of the system work correctly in isolation.

Moving up the stack, `test_discovery.py` validates the network formation and maintenance aspects of the system. It tests how print shops are discovered, how they're grouped into geographic clusters, and how the system handles shop failures or network changes. These tests ensure the distributed network can form and maintain itself correctly, adapting to changes like shops going offline or new shops joining the network. The tests verify that geographic clustering works correctly, that nodes can find their neighbors, and that the system maintains accurate network metrics.

The `test_routing.py` file focuses on the intelligence of the system - how orders are distributed across the network. It verifies both the optimization logic (scoring shops based on location, capacity, and capabilities) and the routing strategies (direct routing, split routing, and geographic routing). These tests ensure orders are routed efficiently, that large orders can be split across multiple shops when needed, and that the system handles constraints like capacity limits and shop capabilities appropriately.

The integration tests are split into two files. `test_cluster.py` tests how shops work together within a cluster, verifying that clusters can handle orders collectively, manage their combined capacity, and coordinate production. `test_e2e.py` provides full system testing, verifying complete workflows from order submission through to completion. It tests real-world scenarios like handling shop failures, managing load distribution, and maintaining service during partial system outages.

Together, the test suite provides comprehensive coverage from unit-level validation of individual components up through complex system-level scenarios. Each test file builds on the previous ones: the model tests validate the core objects, discovery tests verify network formation, routing tests ensure intelligent distribution, cluster tests verify group coordination, and end-to-end tests validate complete system workflows. This layered approach makes it easier to identify issues, with failures in lower-level tests (like model tests) indicating fundamental problems, while failures in higher-level tests (like e2e tests) suggesting integration or coordination issues.

This structure also maps well to debugging scenarios: issues with basic functionality can be investigated through model tests, network problems through discovery tests, distribution problems through routing tests, coordination issues through cluster tests, and system-wide problems through end-to-end tests.
