Here's a comprehensive description of the distributed print shop system:

The system is designed as a distributed network of print shops that coordinate to efficiently fulfill customer orders for customized products. At its core, the system is built around three main packages: models, routing, and network. The models package defines the fundamental data structures: Orders (containing items to be produced), PrintShops (representing production facilities with specific capabilities), and Clusters (geographic groupings of shops). The network package handles the distributed aspects of the system, with NetworkDiscovery managing the overall topology, PrintShopNodes representing individual shops in the network, and a Protocol layer handling inter-node communication. The routing package contains the intelligence for order distribution, with OrderRouter making high-level routing decisions and RouteOptimizer scoring potential shops based on factors like geographic proximity, available capacity, and capabilities.

When an order enters the system through the API layer, it first goes to the OrderRouter, which considers multiple strategies for fulfillment. The router primarily attempts to assign orders to geographic clusters of print shops, optimizing for both delivery distance and production efficiency. If cluster-based routing isn't optimal, the system can fall back to direct shop assignment or even split orders across multiple facilities. Each PrintShopNode operates semi-autonomously, managing its own capacity, inventory, and production queue while coordinating with other nodes through the protocol layer. The NetworkDiscovery service continuously monitors the health and capacity of the network, forming and adjusting clusters as needed to maintain efficient operation.

The system is designed to handle real-world complexities like shop outages, capacity constraints, and inventory management. When a shop becomes unavailable or reaches capacity, the network can automatically redistribute orders to maintain service levels. The optimization layer considers multiple factors when routing orders, including shipping costs, production capabilities, current capacity, and inventory levels. This creates a resilient, self-organizing network that becomes more robust as more print shops are added, naturally balancing load across the network while minimizing shipping costs through intelligent geographic distribution.

This architecture allows the system to scale naturally with business growth while maintaining efficient operation. New print shops can be seamlessly added to the network, automatically forming new clusters or joining existing ones based on their geographic location and capabilities. The distributed nature of the system provides resilience against individual shop failures while enabling efficient resource utilization across the entire network. All of these components work together to create a system that can intelligently route orders to the most appropriate production facilities while maintaining high service levels and operational efficiency.
